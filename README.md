# dotfiles 🏠

My dotfiles, managed via [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io).

## General concepts

- [🐟 Fish](https://fishshell.com) as my shell. POSIX compatibility be damned.
- [🚀 Starship](https://starship.rs) as prompt enhancement.
- [🍺 Homebrew](https://brew.sh) as package manager for macOS.

## Prompt enhancements

I make heavy use of [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for productivity features from the terminal. Some of the keybindings I use:

- `Ctrl-R`: search shell history
- `Ctrl-V`: search environment variables
- `Ctrl-G`: navigate to git repositories
- `Ctrl-F`: search files under `pwd` recursively
- `Ctrl-D`: navigate to directories under `pwd` recursively
