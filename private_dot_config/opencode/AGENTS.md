## Plan mode
 - Make the plan concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Git workflow
 - Always use GitButler via the `but` skill to interact with Git.
 - Use GitButler branches to isolate units of work. Keep fixes in separate branches from features, etc.
 - Use GitButler to create PRs.
 - Read-only operations are acceptable to use with `git` when GitButler does not support them.
 - Use `gh` to read relevant data (PRs, issues, etc) from GitHub.
